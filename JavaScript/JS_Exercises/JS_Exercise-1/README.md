## JavaScript Exercise-1

### Topics covered:
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
1. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

2. Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns its length.

3. Write a program that takes two numbers and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

4. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the larger number.

5. Write a program that displays a string in reverse order.

6. Write a program that takes a number and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

7. Write a program that takes a number and prints the multiplication table for that number.

8. Write a program that takes a number and calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to that number.

9. Write a program that takes a string and prints out the number of vowels in the string.

10. Write a function that takes two arrays of integers as arguments and returns an array of the common elements in both arrays, without any duplicates. The returned array should be sorted in ascending order. For example, given the arrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the function should return [3, 4, 5].
Hint: You may need to use nested loops and conditional statements to solve this problem.
